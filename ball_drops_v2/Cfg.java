// Fall 2020
//
//  A purely static Java class for holding global
//  static variables and static methods
//  This should never be instantiated as an Object!!
//
//  A subset of the Processing related system variables
//  are created here as Java static variables such that
//  they can be used inside of Java class modules.  These 
//  variables are mapped from "Main" tab
//
//  A subset of the Ball related variables are also 
//  created here to facilitate the displaying of lines
//  polygons, colors etc. Also used for Java access
//  to Processing event related variables
//
//  Add additional variables as needed for your Java program

public class Cfg {

  // Processing Related System Variables
  static int pMouseX, pMouseY;
  static boolean pMousePressed, pKeyPressed;
  static char pKey;
  static int pWidth, pHeight;

  // Ball Related System Variables and Methods
